**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**
This app was an educational exercise in allowing for a user to interact with data. There were a few different choices given to students, I chose the scenario of a warehouse/store's inventory. So this application allows for the user to perform CRUD operations on the data representing this inventory.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
-Login/Registration
-Inventory Grid
-Item create/read/update/delete (depending on permissions)

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?**
Broke the project into distinct features (login, CRUD, SMS). Relied on small test iterations to build and confirm features were working as expected. Used documentation and resources like stackoverflow when I ran into unfamiliar scenarios.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?**
All testing was done on virtual devices running in Android Studio's emulator. Issues I encountered during testing revealed the importance of lifecycle management and state persistence

**Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
This is all introductory, so I don't think 'innovation' really came into play - but again when I faced issues referencing docs and other online resources was very helpful.
